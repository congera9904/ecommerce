    <p>lac tanganyika</p>
    The major river flowing into the lake is the Ruzizi River, formed about
    10,000 years ago, which enters the north of the lake from Lake Kivu.[10] The
    Malagarasi River, which is Tanzania's second largest river, enters the east
    side of Lake Tanganyika.[10] The Malagarasi is older than Lake Tanganyika,
    and before the lake was formed, it probably was a headwater of the Lualaba
    River, the main Congo River headstream.[9] The lake has a complex history of
    changing flow patterns, due to its high altitude, great depth, slow rate of
    refill, and mountainous location in a turbulently volcanic area that has
    undergone climate changes. Apparently, it has rarely in the past had an
    outflow to the sea. It has been described as "practically endorheic" for
    this reason. The lake's connection to the sea is dependent on a high water
    level allowing water to overflow out of the lake through the Lukuga River
    into the Congo.[10] When not overflowing, the lake's exit into the Lukuga
    River typically is blocked by sand bars and masses of weed, and instead this
    river depends on its own tributaries, especially the Niemba River, to
    maintain a flow.[9]
